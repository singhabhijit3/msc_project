a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported
the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said
<unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N
although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem
a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story
we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties
there is no asbestos in our products now
neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes
we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute
dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university
the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N
from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said
among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number
four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer
the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said
the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk>
the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said
the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters
the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said
the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine
more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained
in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos
by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed
about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s
areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used
workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters
workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area
there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk>
but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago
it has no bearing on our work force today

the move leaves united illuminating co. and northeast utilities as the remaining outside bidders for ps of new hampshire which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in chapter N bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company
new england electric based in <unk> mass. had offered $ N billion to acquire ps of new hampshire well below the $ N billion value united illuminating places on its bid and the $ N billion northeast says its bid is worth
united illuminating is based in new haven conn. and northeast is based in hartford conn
ps of new hampshire <unk> n.h. values its internal reorganization plan at about $ N billion
john rowe president and chief executive officer of new england electric said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to ps of new hampshire such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating <unk> did n't come true
when we <unk> raising our bid the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years and the rewards seemed a long way out

mr. rowe also noted that political concerns also worried new england electric
no matter who owns ps of new hampshire after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation he said
that attracts attention
it was just another one of the risk factors that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding he added
wilbur ross jr. of rothschild inc. the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders said the withdrawal of new england electric might speed up the reorganization process
the fact that new england proposed lower rate increases N N over seven years against around N N boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders complicated negotiations with state officials mr. ross asserted

the refund was about $ N million more than previously ordered by the illinois commerce commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility
state court judge richard curry ordered edison to make average refunds of about $ N to $ N each to edison customers who have received electric service since april N including about two million customers who have moved during that period
judge curry ordered the refunds to begin feb. N and said that he would n't <unk> any appeals or other attempts to block his order by commonwealth edison
the refund pool may not be held <unk> through another round of appeals judge curry said
commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry 's order
the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual <unk> made until dec. N of this year
commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its N earnings by $ N a share

the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison 's construction expenses and refund any <unk> expenses
the utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its N million customers subject to a refund since N
in august the commission ruled that between $ N million and $ N million of the plant 's construction cost was <unk> and should be <unk> plus interest

the survival of spinoff cray computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and <unk> of its chairman and chief designer seymour cray
not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray so is its balance sheet
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray research inc. will withdraw the almost $ N million in financing it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the <unk> project he heads is scrapped
the documents also said that although the <unk> mr. cray has been working on the project for more than six years the cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype
moreover there have been no orders for the cray-3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects
while many of the risks were anticipated when <unk> cray research first announced the spinoff in may the <unk> it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday
we did n't have much of a choice cray computer 's chief financial officer gregory <unk> said in an interview
the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 and without him it could not be completed
cray research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour
the documents also said that cray computer anticipates <unk> perhaps another $ N million in financing beginning next september
but mr. <unk> called that a <unk> scenario
the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray research stock to jump $ N yesterday to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading
analysts noted yesterday that cray research 's decision to link its $ N million <unk> note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company
it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor said gary p. <unk> of <unk> group inc. minneapolis
cray computer will be a concept stock he said
you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n't
besides the designer 's age other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky <unk> chip technology
the sec documents describe those chips which are made of <unk> <unk> as being so fragile and minute they will require special <unk> handling equipment
in addition the cray-3 will contain N processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer
cray computer also will face intense competition not only from cray research which has about N N of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the <unk> machine a direct competitor with the cray-3 in N
the spinoff also will compete with international business machines corp. and japan 's big three hitachi ltd. nec corp. and fujitsu ltd
the new company said it believes there are fewer than N potential customers for <unk> priced between $ N million and $ N million presumably the cray-3 price range
under terms of the spinoff cray research stockholders are to receive one cray computer share for every two cray research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks
no price for the new shares has been set
instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide
cray computer has applied to trade on nasdaq
analysts calculate cray computer 's initial book value at about $ N a share
along with the note cray research is <unk> about $ N million in assets primarily those related to the cray-3 development which has been a drain on cray research 's earnings
<unk> balance sheets clearly show why cray research favored the spinoff
without the cray-3 research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of $ N million for the first half of N rather than the $ N million it posted
on the other hand had it existed then cray computer would have incurred a $ N million loss
mr. cray who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new colorado springs colo. company as an independent contractor the arrangement he had with cray research

those countries including japan italy canada greece and spain are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose <unk> problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list
gary hoffman a washington lawyer specializing in <unk> cases said the threat of u.s. <unk> combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest prompted the improvements made by south korea taiwan and saudi arabia
what this tells us is that u.s. trade law is working he said
he said mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law
mrs. hills said that the u.s. is still concerned about disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia

the purchases show the strong interest of japanese investors in u.s. <unk> instruments fannie mae 's chairman david o. maxwell said at a news conference
he said more than N N of the funds were placed with japanese institutional investors
the rest went to investors from france and hong kong
earlier this year japanese investors snapped up a similar $ N million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund
that fund was put together by blackstone group a new york investment bank
the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co
the new seven-year funds one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors

it 's the latest investment craze sweeping wall street a rash of new closed-end country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country
no fewer than N country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year triple the level of all of N according to charles e. simon & co. a washington-based research firm

anything 's possible how about the new guinea fund <unk> george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates of <unk> mass
the recent explosion of country funds <unk> the closed-end fund mania of the 1920s mr. foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular
they fell into <unk> after the N crash
unlike traditional <unk> mutual funds most of these <unk> portfolios are the closed-end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly
the surge brings to nearly N the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in new york or london
these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets
people are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says michael porter an analyst at smith barney harris upham & co. new york
behind all the <unk> is some <unk> competition
as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell
and the firms are stretching their <unk> far and wide to do it
financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a <unk> of international securities
and many emerging markets have <unk> more mature markets such as the u.s. and japan
country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies
but it does n't take much to get burned
political and currency gyrations can <unk> the funds
another concern the funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market
when the stock market dropped nearly N N oct. N for instance the mexico fund plunged about N N and the spain fund fell N N
and most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the N crash
what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios
after trading at an average discount of more than N N in late N and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of N N
the reason share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold
it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say
but some european funds recently have skyrocketed spain fund has surged to a startling N N premium
it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to N 's european economic integration
and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums
i 'm very alarmed to see these rich <unk> says smith barney 's mr. porter
the newly <unk> premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr. porter suggests
unlike many u.s. investors those in asia or europe seeking <unk> exposure may be less <unk> to paying higher prices for country funds
there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here mr. porter says
nonetheless plenty of u.s. analysts and money managers are <unk> at the <unk> trading levels of some country funds
they argue that u.s. investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these so-called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the u.s.
that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium
for people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds <unk> 's mr. foot says the only advice i have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly
the u.s. and soviet union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of $ N million in <unk> russian debts owed to the u.s. government the state department said
if the debts are repaid it could clear the way for soviet bonds to be sold in the u.s.
however after two meetings with the soviets a state department spokesman said that it 's too early to say whether that will happen
<unk> with the talks the state department said it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch
the branch of the bank for foreign economic affairs was approved last spring and opened in july
but a soviet bank here would be <unk> unless moscow found a way to settle the $ N million debt which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic <unk> government before the communists seized power in N
under a N law the johnson debt default act as amended it 's illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the u.s. government unless they are members of the world bank and international monetary fund
the u.s.s.r. belongs to neither organization
moscow has settled <unk> debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value
the state department stressed the <unk> debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act
but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the u.s. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world war ii <unk> program
in another reflection that the growth of the economy is <unk> off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in september
meanwhile the national association of purchasing management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month
its index inched up to N N in october from N N in september
any reading below N N suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining
the purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in october after four months of decline
factories booked $ N billion in orders in september nearly the same as the $ N billion in august the commerce department said
if not for a N N surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen N N
in a separate report the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ N billion not significantly different from the $ N billion reported for august
private construction spending was down but government building activity was up
the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but were n't adjusted for inflation
kenneth <unk> economist for society corp. a cleveland bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to <unk> off
at the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry
what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack he asked
i draw a blank
by most measures the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all
factory <unk> fell in september
so did the federal reserve board 's <unk> index
yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession
they cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn
inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance
economists say a buildup in inventories can <unk> cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession
but yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front it said factory inventories fell N N in september the first decline since february N
this <unk> to the soft landing scenario said elliott <unk> an economist at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp
i do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive
a soft landing is an economic slowdown that <unk> inflation without leading to a recession
the department said orders for <unk> goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell N N in september to $ N billion after climbing N N the month before
orders for durable goods were up N N to $ N billion after rising N N the month before
the department previously estimated that <unk> orders fell N N in september
factory shipments fell N N to $ N billion after rising N N in august
shipments have been relatively level since january the commerce department noted
manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose N N in september to $ N billion helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector
excluding these orders backlogs declined N N
in its construction spending report the commerce department said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off N N in september to an annual rate of $ N billion
david <unk> economist for the mortgage bankers association predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes but probably not until early next year
spending on private <unk> construction was off N N to an annual rate of $ N billion with no sector showing strength
government construction spending rose N N to $ N billion
after adjusting for inflation the commerce department said construction spending did n't change in september
for the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about N N above last year 's level
the government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by mcgraw-hill inc. 's <unk> dodge group
dodge reported an N N increase in construction contracts awarded in september
the <unk> counts money as it is spent dodge counts contracts when they are awarded
the government includes money spent on residential <unk> dodge does n't
although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy it is n't <unk> an imminent recession said robert <unk> chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes inc. stamford conn
he said the index would have to be in the low N N range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession
the report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth though still continuing may be slowing
only N N of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in october down from N N in september
and N N said export orders were down last month compared with N N the month before
the <unk> managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control
for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell
the decline was even <unk> than in september
they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months
economists consider that a sign that <unk> pressures are <unk>
when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times <unk> prices tend to rise
the purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than N purchasing executives
each of the survey 's indicators <unk> the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening
for the first time the october survey polled members on imports
it found that of the N N who import N N said they imported more in october and N N said they imported less than the previous month
while acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend mr. <unk> said it does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much
items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one <unk> milk and milk <unk>
it 's an odd thing to put on the list mr. <unk> noted
he said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of <unk> dry milk
they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u.s. exports of dry milk coupled with very low import quotas

this is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event
the irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign has come of age in an <unk> election year with only a few <unk> scattered across the country
but in the three leading political <unk> of N the negative ads have reached new levels of <unk> raising fears that this kind of <unk> empty of significant issues is <unk> in a new era of campaigns without content
now says joseph <unk> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always
a trend that started with the first <unk> of politics accelerated with the <unk> of the television age and became a <unk> art form in N has reached an entirely new stage
to get people 's attention these days says douglas <unk> a political consultant your tv ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means <unk>
and unlike a few years ago you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is <unk>
in N as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves
take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for tuesday 's elections in new york city new jersey and virginia
new york city
the screen <unk> with a small tight <unk> shot of david dinkins democratic candidate for mayor of new york city
david dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years says a <unk> male voice
and then this television commercial paid for by republican rudolph giuliani 's campaign and produced by roger <unk> the master of negative tv ads really gets down to business
mr. dinkins the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately <unk> his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted <unk> through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office
david dinkins says the <unk> why does he always wait until he 's caught
nasty <unk> says john <unk> mr. dinkins 's issues director designed to <unk> a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist
<unk> by the giuliani ads mr. dinkins 's tv consultants robert <unk> and david <unk> finally <unk> a negative ad of their own
the screen shows two distorted <unk> photos presumably of two politicians
compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer
one says he 's for banning <unk> bullets
the other has opposed a ban on <unk> bullets
one claims he 's pro-choice
the other has opposed a woman 's right to choose
funny thing says the <unk> both these candidates are named rudolph giuliani
who 's telling the truth
everybody and nobody
it 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate
mr. dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job
he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it
the city 's campaign finance board has refused to pay mr. dinkins $ N in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete
the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors
and says mr. dinkins he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a <unk> effort had been convicted of <unk>
but say mr. dinkins 's managers he did have an office and his organization did have members
mr. giuliani 's campaign chairman peter powers says the dinkins ad is deceptive
the other side he argues knows giuliani has always been pro-choice even though he has personal reservations
they know he is generally opposed to <unk> bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation
virginia
democratic <unk> gov. douglas wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with republican marshall coleman with an abortion commercial produced by frank <unk> that analysts of every political <unk> agree was a tour de force
against a shot of <unk> <unk> on an american flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that <unk> have <unk> for generations
then just as an image of the <unk> of thomas jefferson <unk> from the screen the announcer continues on the issue of abortion marshall coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians
that commercial which said mr. coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge mr. coleman denies changed the dynamics of the campaign <unk> it at least in part into a <unk> on abortion
the ad prompted mr. coleman the former virginia attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by bob goodman and designed to shake mr. wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad
the coleman <unk> featured a <unk> of a young woman in <unk> and the ad suggested that she was <unk> an <unk> courtroom <unk>
a voice says <unk> now do n't you have <unk>
then an announcer <unk> it was douglas wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age N and younger to be <unk> about their private lives by lawyers for accused <unk>
so the next time mr. wilder talks about the rights of women ask him about this law he tried to pass
mr. wilder did introduce such legislation N years ago but he did so at the request of a <unk> a common legislative technique used by lawmakers
the legislation itself noted that it was introduced by request and in N mr. wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from <unk> <unk>
people have grown tired of these ads and coleman has gotten the <unk> of being a negative <unk> says mark <unk> a political scientist at mary washington college
wilder has managed to get across the idea that coleman will say anything to get elected governor and more important has been able to put the <unk> for all the negative <unk> on coleman
mr. coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive <unk> but the truce lasted only hours
by tuesday night television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr. coleman himself raising questions about mr. wilder 's <unk> to rape victims
new jersey
the attacks began when democratic rep. james florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of <unk> and a photograph of mr. florio 's rival republican rep. jim courter
remember <unk> says a female voice
consider jim courter
and then this commercial produced by bob <unk> gets down to its own mean and <unk> business
pictures of <unk> oil <unk> <unk> into focus and the female voice <unk> that hazardous waste on his mr. courter 's property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud
and the nose on mr. courter 's face grows
the only fraud involved cry mr. courter 's <unk> is the florio commercial itself and so the courter campaign has responded with its own <unk> commercial produced by mr. <unk>
in this one the screen <unk> with photographs of both candidates
who 's really lying asks a female voice
florio 's lying the voice goes on because the barrel on courter 's land contained heating oil was <unk> up and caused no pollution
mr. courter 's long nose <unk> while mr. florio 's grows
who 's telling the truth
stephen <unk> a political scientist at new jersey 's <unk> institute says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate
barrels were dumped on the courter property a complaint was made but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment
even so according to mr. <unk> the ad was devastating because it raised questions about mr. courter 's credibility

japanese investment in southeast asia is <unk> the region toward economic integration
interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest that japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that southeast asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades
but japan 's power in the region also is <unk> fears of domination and <unk> fresh policy questions
the flow of japanese funds has set in motion a process <unk> these economies will be <unk> together by the great japanese investment machine says robert <unk> vice chairman of goldman sachs international corp
in the past five years japanese companies have tripled their commitments in asia to $ N billion
in thailand for example the government 's board of investment approved $ N million of japanese investment in N N times the u.s. investment figure for the year
japan 's commitment in southeast asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade
asia 's other <unk> countries are following japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region
in taiwan and south korea rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for <unk> production
these nations known as asia 's little <unk> also are contributing to southeast asia 's integration but their influence will remain subordinate to japan 's
for <unk> countries such as thailand and malaysia the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth
but asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic <unk> now
because of budget constraints in washington the u.s. encourages japan to share economic burdens in the region
but it <unk> yielding political ground
in the coming decade analysts say <unk> relations will be tested as tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic <unk>
japan 's swelling investment in southeast asia is part of its economic evolution
in the past decade japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export
in the 1990s spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into <unk> with plants around the world
to capture the investment southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business
these nations ' internal decisions will be made in a way not to <unk> their largest aid <unk> largest private investor and largest lender says richard <unk> director of the international business and research program at the university of southern california 's graduate school of business
japanese money will help turn southeast asia into a more <unk> economic region
but analysts say asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the european common market approach
rather japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors says kent <unk> a specialist in east asian economies at the <unk> wilson school for public and <unk> affairs at princeton university
in electronics for example a japanese company might make television picture <unk> in japan <unk> the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia
the effect will be to pull asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone says goldman sachs 's mr. <unk>
countries in the region also are beginning to consider a <unk> for closer economic and political ties
the economic and foreign ministers of N asian and pacific nations will meet in australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications
participants will include the u.s. australia canada japan south korea and new zealand as well as the six members of the association of southeast asian nations thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the philippines and <unk>
in addition the u.s. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the pacific <unk> in a major speech by secretary of state james baker following up a proposal made in january by australian prime minister bob <unk>
the baker proposal <unk> washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region
in asia as in europe a new order is taking shape mr. baker said
the u.s. with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture
but maintaining u.s. influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region
japan not only <unk> the u.s. in investment flows but also <unk> it in trade with most southeast asian countries although the u.s. remains the leading trade partner for all of asia
moreover the japanese government now the world 's largest aid <unk> is pumping far more assistance into the region than the u.s. is
while u.s. officials voice optimism about japan 's <unk> role in asia they also convey an <unk> of caution
there 's an understanding on the part of the u.s. that japan has to expand its functions in asia says j. michael <unk> undersecretary of commerce for trade
if they approach it with a <unk> <unk> attitude there will be a net gain for everyone
some asian nations are <unk> about washington 's demand that tokyo step up its military spending to ease the u.s. security burden in the region
the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the u.s. 's leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible u.s. troop reduction in south korea
many <unk> regard a u.s. presence as a desirable <unk> to japanese influence
no one wants the u.s. to pick up its <unk> and go home mr. <unk> says
for their part taiwan and south korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese <unk>
they do n't want japan to <unk> the region and <unk> it up says <unk> lee professor of east asian politics at the university of pennsylvania
<unk> rice could hardly believe her eyes
while giving the comprehensive test of basic skills to ninth <unk> at greenville high school last march N she spotted a student looking at <unk> sheets
she had seen cheating before but these notes were <unk>
a <unk> is an example of a profession in trade and finance
at the end of world war ii germany surrendered before japan
the <unk> conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the house and senate in different forms
virtually word for word the notes matched questions and answers on the <unk> section of the test the student was taking
in fact the student had the answers to almost all of the N questions in that section
the student surrendered the notes but not without a protest
my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test he said
the teacher in question was nancy yeargin considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school
confronted mrs. yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two <unk> geography classes
she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead <unk> and <unk> the answers
mrs. yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security
in september she pleaded guilty and paid a $ N fine
her alternative was N days in jail
her story is partly one of personal <unk>
she was an <unk> teacher who won <unk> and inspired students but she will probably never teach again
in her wake she left the <unk> and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a <unk> of colleagues who say she brought them shame of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated <unk> and of <unk> officials stunned that despite the <unk> nature of her actions she became something of a local <unk>
mrs. yeargin 's case also <unk> some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where <unk> testing has enhanced the temptation to <unk>
the N statute mrs. yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of south carolina 's <unk> laws
prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's N education improvement act
the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher <unk> scores
there is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores says walt <unk> an education professor and testing specialist at boston college
so efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise
and most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing
a <unk> study released in september by friends for education an <unk> n.m. <unk> group concluded that outright cheating by american educators is common
the group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as mrs. yeargin did although most are never caught
evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so
california 's education department suspects adult responsibility for <unk> at N schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test
after numerous <unk> of questionable teacher help to students texas is <unk> its security practices
and sales of <unk> booklets for classroom instruction are booming
these materials including <unk> school publishing co. 's scoring high and learning materials are nothing short of sophisticated <unk> sheets according to some recent academic research
by using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students <unk> the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers
use of scoring high is widespread in south carolina and common in greenville county mrs. yeargin 's school district
experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in south carolina
under the state 's education improvement act low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into <unk> <unk> <unk> that can mean <unk>
high test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the <unk>
and south carolina says it is getting results
since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the <unk> <unk> test than south carolina although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about N states who use the sat as the primary college <unk> examination
critics say south carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much
friends of education rates south carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating
says the organization 's founder john <unk> <unk> mrs. yeargin is a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all
paul <unk> director of testing for the south carolina department of education says mr. <unk> 's allegations of cheating are <unk> without foundation and based on unfair <unk>
partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says the state will begin keeping closer track of <unk> preparation booklets next spring
south carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like greenville high school
standing on a <unk> hill in a <unk> area of this old textile city the school has educated many of south carolina 's best and <unk> including the state 's last two governors nobel prize winning <unk> charles <unk> and actress <unk> <unk>
but by the early 1980s its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad <unk>
it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class says linda ward the school 's principal
crime was awful test scores were low and there was no <unk> in <unk> programs
mrs. ward took over in N becoming the school 's seventh principal in N years
her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown
prior to his term a teacher <unk> to death in the halls <unk> by a student
<unk> mrs. ward says the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two <unk> and evenly split student groups a <unk> white elite from old <unk> neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from <unk> inner city neighborhoods
mrs. ward resolved to clean out <unk> in the school 's faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf
one was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and <unk> in a new public spirit for school <unk>
another was nancy yeargin who came to greenville in N full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward
being a teacher just became my life says the <unk> mrs. yeargin a teacher for N years before her dismissal
i loved the school its history
i even <unk> about school and new things to do with my students
while mrs. ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve <unk> mrs. yeargin worked <unk> days and fast became a student favorite
in N and N she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law
encouraged by mrs. ward mrs. yeargin taught honor students in the state teacher <unk> program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career
she won grant money for the school advised <unk> ran the <unk> club proposed and taught a new cultural <unk> class in western <unk> and was chosen by the school <unk> as teacher of the year
she was an <unk> lady she had it all together says <unk> <unk> a freshman at the university of south carolina who had mrs. yeargin in the <unk> class last year
she says that because of mrs. yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher
mary beth <unk> a greenville <unk> <unk> also says mrs. yeargin inspired her to go into education
she taught us more in western <unk> than i 've ever learned in other classes says <unk> green a greenville senior
in the classroom students say mrs. yeargin distinguished herself by <unk> teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using <unk> type <unk>
on <unk> she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom
she just never gave it up says mary <unk> mary beth 's mother
you 'd see her <unk> <unk> in the stands at a football game
some fellow teachers however viewed mrs. yeargin as <unk> and too yielding to students
mrs. ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a <unk>
pressures began to build
friends told her she was pushing too hard
because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer
mrs. yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's <unk> program
but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests
huge gains by her students in N and N meant a total of $ N in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ N
winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her mrs. yeargin insists
but others at greenville high say she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition
mary elizabeth <unk> another <unk> teacher says she believed mrs. yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing
indeed mrs. yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher <unk> program
last march after attending a teaching <unk> in washington mrs. yeargin says she returned to greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her <unk> geography students adequately
when test booklets were passed out N hours ahead of time she says she <unk> questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students
mrs. yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her <unk> were correct
i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says
only five of the N questions were geography questions
the rest were history <unk> finance subjects they never had
mrs. yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift greenville high school 's overall test scores usually near the bottom of N district high schools in <unk> carried annually by local newspapers
mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to <unk> that her <unk> students would suffer from doing badly on the test
these kids broke my heart she says
a whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive
they desperately needed somebody who showed they <unk> for them who loved them
the last thing they needed was another <unk> blow
school officials and prosecutors say mrs. yeargin is lying
they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case was n't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly
that pretty much <unk> any <unk> that she was out to help the poor <unk> child says joe watson the prosecutor in the case who is also president of greenville high school 's <unk> association
mrs. yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding i wanted to help all students
mr. watson says mrs. yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair
do i have much <unk> for her mr. watson asks
not really
i believe in the system
i believe you have to use the system to change it
what she did was like taking the law into your own hands
mrs. ward says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the <unk> public disclosure that a trial would bring
she says she offered mrs. yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate
mrs. yeargin declined
she said something like you just want to make it easy for the school
i was <unk> mrs. ward recalls
it was like someone had turned a <unk> in me
to the <unk> and <unk> of her <unk> and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the <unk> of standardized tests <unk> yeargin won widespread local support
the <unk> hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf
supportive callers <unk> unfair testing not mrs. yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared
the show did n't give the <unk> of mrs. yeargin 's <unk> saying only that she helped students do better on the test
the message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our <unk> and our testing policies in this state said the <unk> host
<unk> in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs. yeargin was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being <unk>
the radio show <unk> us says mrs. ward
partly because of the show mr. watson says the district decided not to recommend mrs. yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have <unk> the charges and the conviction from her record
and legal authorities <unk> up an investigation worthy of a murder case
over N witnesses mostly students were interviewed
at greenville high school meanwhile some students especially on the <unk> <unk> were crushed
it 's hard to explain to a <unk> why someone they like had to go says mrs. ward
soon <unk> appeared in the <unk> that carried the school 's familiar <unk> <unk> <unk> on the front
on the back the shirts read we have all the answers
many colleagues are angry at mrs. yeargin
she did a lot of harm says <unk> rice who had discovered the <unk> notes
we work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair <unk> on all of us
but several teachers also say the incident <unk> doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores
says <unk> key a <unk> teacher the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of <unk>
there may be others doing what she did
mrs. yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win <unk> and because she was afraid of further charges
mrs. ward for one was relieved
despite the strong evidence against mrs. yeargin popular sentiment was so strong in her favor mrs. ward says that i 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her
since <unk> first touched slate <unk> have wanted to know what 's on the test
these days students can often find the answer in <unk> <unk> and <unk> their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests
the <unk> section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth <unk> what is another name for the roman <unk> <unk>
it also asks them to add <unk> and <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> <unk> called learning materials sold to schools across the country by <unk> school publishing co. contain the same questions
in many other <unk> there is almost no difference between the real test and learning materials
what 's more the test and learning materials are both produced by the same company <unk> a joint venture of mcgraw-hill inc. and macmillan 's parent britain 's maxwell communication corp
close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say
<unk> booklets software and <unk> are a booming publishing <unk>
but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of <unk> cheating
if i took these preparation booklets into my classroom i 'd have a hard time <unk> to my students and parents that it was n't cheating says john <unk> a <unk> city mich. teacher who has studied test <unk>
he and other critics say such <unk> aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress
it 's as if france decided to give only french history questions to students in a european history class and when everybody <unk> the test they say their kids are good in european history says john <unk> an <unk> n.m. <unk> and founder of an educational research organization friends for education which has studied standardized testing
standardized achievement tests are given about N million times a year across the country to students generally from <unk> through eighth grade
the most widely used of these tests are <unk> 's cat and comprehensive test of basic skills the iowa test of basic skills by <unk> <unk> co. and <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. 's metropolitan achievement test and stanford achievement test
sales figures of the <unk> materials are n't known but their reach into schools is significant
in arizona california florida louisiana maryland new jersey south carolina and texas educators say they are common classroom tools
<unk> says well over N million of its scoring high <unk> books have been sold since their introduction N years ago with most sales in the last five years
about N sets of learning materials teachers ' <unk> have also been sold in the past four years
the materials in each set reach about N students
scoring high and learning materials are the <unk> preparation tests
michael kean director of marketing for <unk> <unk> the <unk> division that publishes learning materials says it is n't aimed at improving test scores
he also asserted that exact questions were n't <unk>
when referred to the questions that matched he said it was <unk>
mr. <unk> the <unk> and william <unk> a michigan state university education professor concluded in a study last june that cat test versions of scoring high and learning materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test
they devised a <unk> scale <unk> one point for each <unk> measured on the cat test to rate the <unk> of test <unk> to the <unk> cat
because many of these <unk> the <unk> of <unk> figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar <unk> for example are only a small part of the total <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> says the preparation <unk> would n't <unk> too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general <unk> with test procedures
but learning materials matched on N of N <unk>
scoring high matched on N
in cat sections where students ' knowledge of <unk> <unk> sounds is tested the authors noted that scoring high concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth <unk> should know
learning materials for the <unk> contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items
rick <unk> senior editor of scoring high says that messrs. <unk> and <unk> are ignoring the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format
he said authors of scoring high <unk> avoid <unk> exact questions but he does n't deny that some items are similar
when scoring high first came out in N it was a publication of random house
mcgraw-hill was <unk>
in a N advisory to educators mcgraw-hill said scoring high should n't be used because it represented a parallel form of the cat and <unk> tests
but in N mcgraw-hill purchased the random house unit that publishes scoring high which later became part of <unk>
messrs. <unk> and kean say they are <unk> of any efforts by mcgraw-hill to modify or <unk> scoring high
<unk> corp. said it completed the acquisition of sacramento savings & loan association from the <unk> & <unk> c. <unk> foundation for $ N million
the <unk> s&l which has N branch offices in north central california had assets of $ N billion at the end of september
new york-based <unk> is an insurance and financial services concern
the purchase price includes two <unk> companies
the department of health and human services plans to extend its <unk> on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants
medical researchers believe the <unk> of small amounts of <unk> tissue into humans could help treat <unk> <unk> and such <unk> diseases as <unk> 's <unk> 's and <unk> 's
but anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of <unk> using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions
james mason assistant secretary for health said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research should be continued indefinitely
he said the ban wo n't stop privately funded <unk> research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants
department officials say that hhs secretary louis sullivan will support dr. mason 's ruling which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the national institutes of health
both dr. mason and dr. sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion as does president bush except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened
the controversy began in N when the national institutes of health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an hhs review of its plan to <unk> <unk> tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from <unk> 's disease
the department placed a <unk> on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues
a majority of an <unk> panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became <unk> in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding
the dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the nih and the centers for disease control
several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants
antonio novello whom mr. bush <unk> to serve as surgeon general reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion
dr. novello is deputy director of the national institute of child health and human development
some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts
earlier this week dr. sullivan tried to <unk> these charges by stressing that candidates to head the nih and the <unk> will be <unk> by standards of scientific and administrative <unk> not politics
but the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue <unk> many scientists
when scientific progress moves into <unk> ground there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications says <unk> <unk> associate dean of the yale medical school
the disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become <unk> so that no mechanism exists for finding a middle ground
yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants
but dr. <unk> warns that dr. mason 's ruling may discourage private funding
the <unk> of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said
despite the <unk> over transplants federal funding of research involving <unk> <unk> will continue on a number of fronts
such research may ultimately result in the ability to <unk> damaged <unk> or to turn off genes that cause cancer or to regulate genes that cause down 's syndrome the leading cause of mental <unk> according to an nih summary
the nih currently spends about $ N million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ N billion

the internal revenue service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ N in cash
the warnings issued to at least N criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim the information is protected by <unk> privilege
the irs warnings stem from a N law that requires anyone who receives more than $ N in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions in the course of trade or business to report the payment on a document known as form N
the form asks for such details as the client 's name social security number <unk> number and details about the services provided for the payment
failure to complete the form had been punishable as a <unk> until last november when congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to N years in prison
attorneys have argued since N when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their <unk> to be known
many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the irs in recent years citing <unk> privilege
until last week the irs rarely acted on the incomplete forms
this form forces a lawyer to become in effect a witness against his client said neal r. <unk> president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers
the irs is asking lawyers to <unk> a criminal problem to the government added mr. <unk> a miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the <unk> irs forms sent by certified mail
mr. <unk> said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts
these individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers
mr. <unk> said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers
filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the irs off and spark action against the clients he said
the defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week <unk> by new york attorney gerald <unk> to deal with the matter
the american bar association 's house of delegates passed a resolution in N <unk> the irs reporting requirement
michael ross a new york lawyer who heads the aba 's grand jury committee said that lawyers are prohibited by the aba 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death
mr. ross said he met with officials of the irs and the justice department which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers to discuss the issue last may
at that meeting he said the justice department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice
mr. ross said irs officials opposed the justice department 's moderate stance on the matter
but in the letters sent in recent days christopher j. <unk> of the irs computing center in detroit told attorneys that failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in <unk> enforcement action being initiated
in some cases the irs asked for information dating back to forms it received in N
a spokesman for the irs confirmed that there has been <unk> <unk> about incomplete <unk> but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now
individuals familiar with the justice department 's policy said that justice officials had n't any knowledge of the irs 's actions in the last week

not counting the extraordinary charge the company said it would have had a net loss of $ N million or seven cents a share

a spokesman for temple estimated that sea containers ' plan if all the asset sales <unk> would result in shareholders receiving only $ N to $ N a share in cash

there are certain <unk> wines that can command these higher prices says larry shapiro of <unk> 's one of the largest wine shops in dallas
what 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out
we 're seeing it partly because older <unk> are growing more scarce
wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines mr. shapiro continued we 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the <unk> and <unk> which go for $ N to $ N a bottle
some of the newer wines even at $ N to $ N a bottle or so almost offer a bargain
take lake <unk> cabernet from diamond creek
it 's made only in years when the <unk> <unk> perfectly the last was N and comes from a single <unk> of <unk> that yielded a mere N cases in N
owner al <unk> originally planned to sell it for $ N a bottle but when a retailer in southern california asked is that wholesale or retail he <unk> the matter
offering the wine at roughly $ N a bottle wholesale $ N retail he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers N no the wine is too high N responses N yes it 's high but i 'll take it N responses N i 'll take all i can get N responses
the wine was shipped in <unk> cases instead of the usual N but even at that it was spread thin going to N retailers in N states
we thought it was <unk> expensive said sterling <unk> wine director at <unk> 's in <unk> ill. one of the top stores in suburban chicago but there are people out there with very different opinions of value
we got our two <unk> and they 're gone
mr. <unk> <unk> that he thinks <unk> prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on
even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move
there may be <unk> reaction initially said mr. <unk> but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the <unk> price to add it to their collection
it 's just sort of a <unk> thing with some people added larry shapiro
they like to talk about having the new red rock <unk> one of diamond creek 's <unk> or the dunn N cabernet or the <unk>
producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people
that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly
but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago
they wo n't buy if the quality is not there said <unk> martin of martin wine <unk> in new orleans
or if they feel the wine is <unk> and they can get something equally good for less
mr. martin has increased prices on some wines like <unk> hills <unk> now $ N just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the $ N to $ N range
image has of course a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't and it ca n't be forced
wine merchants ca n't keep <unk> <unk> in stock but they have to push salon <unk> <unk> even lowering the price from $ N to $ N
it 's hardly a question of quality the N salon is a beautiful wine but as mr. <unk> noted people have their own ideas about value
it 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door
in every major market in the u.s. for instance you can buy <unk> la <unk> or <unk> virtually all of the first growth <unk> except <unk> as well as <unk> one and <unk> from california and at the moment the <unk> 's leap N <unk> N
with the biggest <unk> period of the year looming as the holidays approach it will be interesting to see how the <unk> fare
by january it should be fairly clear what 's hot and what 's not

signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the federal reserve to cut short-term interest rates but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so

retail sales also were reported slow in most districts particularly for discretionary <unk> items such as furniture home appliances and consumer electronics

despite the economic slowdown there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt

mr. black said he is pleased with the economy 's recent performance and does n't see a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession

criticism in the u.s. over recent japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries ' relations
officials from both nations say the u.s. public 's <unk> about japanese investment could color a second round of <unk> economic talks scheduled for next week in washington
not that washington and tokyo disagree on the japanese acquisitions indeed each has come out in favor of <unk> investment in the u.s.
where they disagree is on the subject of u.s. direct investment in japan
the u.s. wants the removal of what it <unk> as barriers to investment japan denies there are real barriers
the <unk> talk <unk> up by recent japanese investments in the u.s. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the <unk> talks known as the structural <unk> initiative
the japanese should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy says charles <unk> u.s. assistant treasury secretary who has been in tokyo this week <unk> discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders
we have a long history of maintaining an open <unk> policy mr. <unk> says
u.s. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment in japan
the japanese <unk> openly about the u.s. public 's <unk>
one clear sign of japan 's nervousness came this week when a spokesman for japan 's foreign ministry devoted nearly all of a regular half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent japanese investments in the u.s.
we believe that it is <unk> important for those japanese business interests in the u.s. to be more aware of the <unk> and concerns of the american people said the spokesman <unk> <unk>
at the same time though he <unk> the media for paying such close attention to japanese investment when other foreign countries notably britain are acquiring more american assets
fears that japanese investors are buying up america have <unk> sharply in the past several weeks with sony corp. 's purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc. from coca-cola co. and mitsubishi estate co. 's acquisition of a N N holding in rockefeller group the owner of some of <unk> manhattan 's most exclusive real estate
even before those moves added fuel the fires of <unk> had been well <unk> by the highly publicized experience in japan of one u.s. investor t. boone pickens jr
the texas <unk> has acquired a N N stake valued at more than $ N billion in an <unk> company <unk> manufacturing co
but he has failed to gain any influence at the company
<unk> has refused to grant mr. pickens seats on its board <unk> he is a <unk> trying to pressure <unk> 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit
mr. pickens made considerable political <unk> with his troubles in japan
the senate finance committee <unk> by a fellow <unk> democratic sen. lloyd <unk> last month urged u.s. trade representative carla hills to use mr. pickens 's experience in talks with tokyo to highlight this problem facing americans who seek access to the japanese capital markets
while mr. <unk> and japanese officials say the question of investors ' access to the u.s. and japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks
among them are differences in savings and investment rates corporate structures and management and government spending
each side has a <unk> of recommendations for the other
the u.s. says it is anxious for results
we feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified and we need it by next spring mr. <unk> says
both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed
but they have n't <unk> what those might be
after the first set of meetings two months ago some u.s. officials complained that japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make
the japanese <unk> that the first round was too early to make concessions
just to say the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything says a ministry of international trade and industry official
we need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it
that process of <unk> out <unk> is likely to take time the japanese say no matter how badly the u.s. wants quick results
for instance at the first meeting the two sides could n't even agree on basic data used in price discussions
since then a team of about N <unk> and u.s. commerce department officials have crossed the globe <unk> consumer prices
by monday they hope to have a <unk> of documents both sides can trust
little by little there is progress says the <unk> official

while worry grows about big japanese investments in the u.s. japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in america 's smaller business
for japan the controversial trend improves access to american markets and technology
but for small american companies it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help
take the deal with candela laser corp. a <unk> mass. manufacturer of high-tech medical devices which three years ago set its sights on japan as an export market
partly to help clear the <unk> obstacles facing any overseas company trying to <unk> japan tiny candela turned to mitsui & co. one of japan 's largest trading companies for investment
in a joint-venture deal mitsui <unk> candela through tokyo 's bureaucratic <unk>
it eventually secured ministry of health import approval for two candela laser products one that breaks up kidney stones and another that <unk> skin <unk>
at last count candela had sold $ N million of its medical devices in japan
the deal also gave mitsui access to a high-tech medical product
they view this as a growth area so they went about it with a <unk> approach says richard <unk> a candela vice president
indeed for many japanese trading companies the favorite u.s. small business is one whose research and development can be <unk> for future japanese use
the japanese companies <unk> many small u.s. companies with promising products or ideas frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch
japanese companies have financed small and medium-sized u.s. firms for years but in recent months the pace has taken off
in the first half of N alone japanese corporations invested $ N million in minority positions in u.s. companies a N N rise from the figure for all of N reports venture economics inc
the needham mass. concern tracks investments in new businesses
in addition of course some of the japanese investments involved outright purchase of small u.s. firms
heightened japanese interest in american small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving japanese companies control of large highly visible u.s. corporations such as columbia pictures entertainment inc
only this week it was announced that mitsubishi estate co. had acquired a N N stake in rockefeller group which owns new york 's prestigious rockefeller center
while the small deals are far less <unk> they add to japanese <unk> of the u.s. market

strategic objectives not financial return drive many of the deals says a venture economics spokesman
in investing on the basis of future transactions a role often performed by merchant banks trading companies can cut through the <unk> that <unk> owners often face with their local commercial banks
it 's the classic problem of the small businessman says malcolm <unk> managing director of trading alliance corp. of new york
people are <unk> at the door to take his product but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very <unk>
they want assets they want a balance sheet which has no <unk> to the business a company can generate
adds mitsui 's mr. <unk> unlike corporations in this country trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows
to the extent they can do this they 're quite content to get a return on investment of N N to N N
mr. <unk> says mitsui has N u.s. subsidiaries in which it holds N N interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its u.s. affiliates in N

for N years <unk> <unk> went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient
a <unk> customer that banks <unk> for she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving nor to the fees she was paying
but in august first atlanta national bank introduced its crown account a package designed to lure customers such as ms. <unk>
among other things it included checking safe deposit box and credit card all for free plus a good deal on installment loans
all she had to do was put $ N in a certificate of deposit or qualify for a $ N personal line of credit
i deserve something for my loyalty she says
she took her business to first atlanta
so it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days
for nearly a decade banks have <unk> for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans
the competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services
but many banks are turning away from strict price competition
instead they are trying to build customer loyalty by <unk> their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population
you 're dead in the water if you are n't <unk> the market says anne moore president of <unk> research corp. a bank consulting firm in atlanta
ncnb corp. of charlotte n.c. recently introduced its financial connections program aimed at young adults just starting careers

in september union <unk> corp. of memphis tenn. launched the edge account a package designed for the <unk> crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans
the theory such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years
for some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the <unk> segment with the highest savings
those efforts are being stepped up

banks have tried packaging before
in N wells fargo & co. of san francisco launched the gold account which included free checking a credit card <unk> box and travelers checks for a $ N monthly fee
the concept <unk> a slew of <unk> but the banks stopped promoting the packages
one big reason thin margins
many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to <unk> and could n't target market <unk> that would have made the programs more profitable
as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs
but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography
they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s
deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as <unk> cds
where a bank once offered a standard <unk> savings account it began offering money-market accounts certificates of deposit and <unk> checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits
the competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as <unk> corp. of minneapolis and chemical banking corp. of new york extend their market-share <unk> into small towns across the nation
today a banker is worrying about local regional and <unk> banks as well as thrifts and credit unions says ms. moore at <unk> research
so people who were n't even thinking about targeting N years ago are scrambling to define their customer base
the competition has <unk> a much <unk> consumer
the average household will spread N accounts over a dozen financial institutions says michael p. sullivan who runs his own bank consulting firm in charlotte n.c
this much <unk> makes attracting and keeping today 's <unk> customers costly
packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place
for their troubles the banks get a larger <unk> audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate
the more accounts customers have mr. sullivan says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it
that can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to <unk>
packaging has some <unk>
the additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive
chemical bank spent more than $ N million to introduce its <unk> line several packages aimed at different segments in N according to thomas jacob senior vice president of marketing
it 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay mr. jacob says
still bankers expect packaging to <unk> primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs
these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them ms. moore says
some banks are already moving in that direction according to alvin t. sale marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte
first union he says now has packages for seven customer groups
soon it will split those into N
says mr. sale i think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store not the <unk>

as a foster corporate parent you 'll be helping a neighborhood s&l in areas crucial to its survival
like healthy regulatory capital
a steady deposit base

at the same time you 'll give your foster savings institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors for good
as a foster corporate parent you will experience the same <unk> felt by robert bass lewis <unk> william simon and others who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves
that builds confidence <unk> <unk> not to mention critical regulatory net worth
do n't wait a savings institution needs your help now
every day you delay a savings institution 's health and the federal budget deficit grows worse
think about the good you can do for just $ N a month about the cost of a <unk> chevrolet or two <unk> at a state university
then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad <unk> in the press and on its bottom line
every $ N you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale and keep your foster savings institution off the federal budget deficit

the chicago merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its standard & poor 's N stock-index futures pit once s&p N futures fell N index points the equivalent of about a <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average
if the <unk> limit is triggered after N p.m chicago time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at N p.m
with the limit in effect members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices but not below it
the exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on friday oct. N when the dow jones industrials plunged N points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well
late that afternoon the s&p N stock-index futures contract fell a total of N index points hitting a merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session
the merc said that its existing <unk> <unk> limit on s&p N stock-index futures trading equal to about N points on the dow jones industrials which was triggered oct. N will remain in effect
leo <unk> merc executive committee chairman said that the <unk> limit appeared to <unk> the selling panic oct. N
but when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the <unk> limit indicated that the intermediate limit of N points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices <unk>
several traders maintained that the merc 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the market slide oct. N by <unk> additional selling pressure to the floor of the new york stock exchange
all of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly
the exchange also said that the <unk> circuit breaker which currently provides only a one-hour <unk> during market <unk> will become the maximum one-day limit for the s&p N stock-index futures contract the one-day limit now is N index points
a final <unk> was made to the <unk> opening limit for the contract
the merc said that <unk> limit will remain in effect for the first N minutes of trading
the limit <unk> under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening N minutes of trading
in washington house aides said mr. phelan told congressmen that the collar which banned program trades through the big board 's computer when the dow jones industrial average moved N points did n't work well
he said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades <unk>
in a <unk> news conference mr. phelan who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility said he told the house finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal providing the sec would be comfortable with the language in a bill
the program-trading issue is heating up on capitol hill as it is on wall street and several legislators want to grant the sec the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile
sec chairman richard breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have <unk> trigger points but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs
a house aide suggested that mr. phelan was so vague and <unk> that it was the kind of meeting where people of all <unk> could come out feeling good
at one point mr. phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman rep. edward markey d. mass. by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers
markey said we could have done this in public because so little sensitive information was disclosed the aide said
mr. phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel the aide added
at another point during the hearing rep. markey asked mr. phelan what would be discussed at a new york exchange board meeting today
mr. phelan said the big board is likely to study the program-trading issue
that response <unk> rep. markey house aides said and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter
<unk> of the N subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably rep. john dingell d. mich. the full house energy and commerce committee chairman who has been willing to let mr. markey carry the legislation in recent months
mr. dingell expressed concern sources said about <unk> problems in <unk> program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades
the futures industry is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission which reports to the agriculture committees in both houses
the art of <unk> is <unk> to the english and like most english <unk> <unk> to the rest of the world
<unk> l. <unk> the nine <unk>
<unk> england
of all scenes that <unk> rural england this is one of the <unk> an ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells <unk> from its tower calling the <unk> to <unk>
the <unk> of st. michael and all angels stop to <unk> at the church door as members here always have
in the tower five men and women pull <unk> on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in N
but there is also a <unk> modern note in <unk> though it ca n't be heard by the <unk> enjoying the <unk> of bells this cool autumn evening
like most of the other N <unk> in britain with sets of bells st. michael once had its own band of ringers who would herald every sunday morning and evening service
now only one local ringer remains <unk> <unk> hammond
the others here today live elsewhere
they belong to a group of N ringers including two <unk> and four youngsters in training who drive every sunday from church to church in a <unk> effort to keep the bells <unk> in the many <unk> of east <unk>
to ring for even one service at this tower we have to <unk> says mr. hammond a retired <unk> worker
we 've tried to train the youngsters but they have their <unk> and their <unk> and they just <unk> away
mr. hammond worries that old age and the <unk> of youth will <unk> the ranks of the east <unk> group that keeps the <unk> bells <unk>
history after all is not on his side
according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of england 's church bells are no longer <unk> on <unk> because there is no one to ring them
it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes
the less complicated version of playing <unk> on bells as do the <unk> of continental europe is considered by the english to be <unk> fit only for foreigners
<unk> a <unk> exercise the english invented N years ago requires physical <unk> some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration
proper english bells are started off in <unk> from the <unk> bell to the lowest a simple <unk> scale using in larger <unk> as many as N bells
then at a signal the ringers begin <unk> the order in which the bells sound without <unk> the steady <unk> of the striking
each <unk> or change can occur only once the rules state
ringers <unk> patterns of changes known as methods which have <unk> names like kent <unk> bob major or <unk> <unk>
a series of N or so changes is a <unk> and takes about three hours
a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary <unk> church in the <unk> district of london gives an idea of the work involved
ten <unk> ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a <unk> 's stance each pulling a <unk> that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber
no one speaks and the <unk> of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves <unk> by the ceiling
totally absorbed the ringers <unk> straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it <unk> to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls
far above in the <unk> the huge <unk> bells mounted on wheels swing <unk> through a full N degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the <unk> or <unk> position
skilled ringers use their <unk> to advance or <unk> the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change
in a well-known <unk> involving church bells english novelist <unk> l. <unk> described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in <unk> <unk> and mechanical <unk>
ringers she added are filled with the <unk> <unk> that comes of <unk> <unk> <unk> performed
ringing does become a bit of an <unk> admits <unk> <unk> master of the band at st. mary <unk> and one of england 's best female ringers
it is a passion that usually stays in the tower however
more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the <unk>
when their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often <unk> off to the local <unk> leaving <unk> for others below
this does not sit well with some <unk>
with membership of the church of england steadily <unk> <unk> <unk> are pressing equally <unk> and often <unk> ringers to attend services
two years ago the rev. <unk> <unk> vicar of great <unk> <unk> got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he <unk> the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest
they were a <unk> club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the vicar <unk> says
an entirely new band <unk> today at great <unk> several of whom are members of the <unk>
but there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells
at st. mary 's church in <unk> <unk> the bells have fallen silent following a <unk> over church attendance
the vicar <unk> jones refuses to talk about it saying it would reopen the wound
but <unk> marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the <unk> from the bell tower that are located next to the <unk>
so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the <unk> is at <unk> he says
vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active <unk> himself
the sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says
i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that <unk> life
the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with <unk> says john c. baldwin president
it hopes to speak to students at <unk> colleges about the <unk> of bell ringing and will shortly publish a <unk> for every vicar in the country entitled the bells in your care
says mr. baldwin we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience
mr. baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers
one survey says that of the N trained <unk> in england today only N of them still ring
also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be <unk> like in small rural <unk> and inner-city <unk>
but the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says mr. baldwin
right now we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of N he adds
one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once <unk> field more than a third of the ringers today are women
they are n't accepted everywhere however
the oldest <unk> group in the country the ancient society of college <unk> founded in N remains <unk> a fact that 's particularly <unk> to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for britain 's most prestigious <unk> st. paul 's <unk> and <unk> <unk>
this being britain no woman has filed an <unk> suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to the ringing world a weekly newspaper for ringers
one writer signing his letter as <unk> balanced male <unk> on the frequency of women <unk> in <unk> and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings
in the <unk> of replies that followed one woman ringer from <unk> observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be <unk> badly dressed <unk> with <unk> and a large <unk> frequently <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk>
another women wrote from <unk> to say that in her N years of ringing i have never known a lady to <unk> in the <unk>
i have seen one or two men die <unk> them
investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable <unk> of quarterly dividend checks
that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than N N
but do n't <unk> too easy those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn
in the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over
that can be a trap for <unk> investors says richard bernstein senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co
strong dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female <unk> that attract males and then kill them after <unk>
stephen boesel president of t. rowe price growth and income fund explains that companies raise their payouts most <unk> only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time
invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to <unk> environments he says
and <unk> environments are n't <unk> to the stock market
indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical <unk>
in N for example dividends on the stocks in standard & poor 's 500-stock index soared N N following much slower growth the year before
the s&p index started sliding in price in september N and fell N N in N despite a N N expansion in dividends that year
that pattern has n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious
payouts on the s&p N stocks rose N N in N according to standard & poor 's corp. and wall street estimates for N growth are generally between N N and N N
many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double-digit gains continuing
meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen <unk> their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices
as a result the market 's dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and <unk> by historical standards
put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say
they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p N
the figure is currently about N N up from N N before the recent market slide
some analysts say investors should run for the <unk> if a sustained market rebound <unk> the yield below N N
a drop below that N N benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says mr. boesel of t. rowe price
in fact the market has always <unk>
always
there 's never been an exception says gerald w. <unk> a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock-market data
the last time the s&p N yield dropped below N N was in the summer of N
stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle
there have been only seven other times in N N N N N N and N when the yield on the s&p N dropped below N N for at least two consecutive months mr. <unk> found
and in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year
still some market analysts say the current N N reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past
it 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not <unk> in a traditional manner says james h. <unk> head of stock investments for cigna corp. the <unk> insurer
in particular mr. <unk> says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically
so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength
rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes steven g. einhorn <unk> of the investment policy committee at goldman sachs & co
he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about N N
that is just a <unk> below the average of the past N years or so he says
what will happen to dividend growth next year
common wisdom suggests a <unk> rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits
painewebber inc. for instance is forecasting growth in s&p N dividends of just under N N in N down from an estimated N N this year
in other years in which there have been moderate economic <unk> the environment the firm expects in N the change in dividends ranged from a gain of N N to a decline of N N according to painewebber analyst thomas <unk>
the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial <unk> this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken
dividend growth on the order of N N is expected by both mr. <unk> of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman sachs
those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures
one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends
a total of N companies raised dividends in october basically unchanged from N a year ago s&p said wednesday
that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace
while the s&p tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further <unk> in the number of dividend increases could be a <unk> of slower dividend growth next year
in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels
mr. einhorn of goldman sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a N N to N N total return from appreciation and dividends over the next N months vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps N N or N N if dividend growth is weak
but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also expects N N growth in dividends next year does n't think it will help the overall market all that much
having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think it 's a main consideration he says
with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels
your oct. N page-one story on the renewed plight of western union says that western union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down alexander graham bell 's offer to it of his <unk> because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph

it was richard nixon 's first visit to china in N that set in motion the historic <unk> between beijing and washington

mr. nixon the most prominent american to come to china since beijing 's bloody <unk> of pro-democracy demonstrators in june <unk> on international <unk> over the massacre
the chinese in turn took aim at american <unk> in china 's domestic affairs
one official newspaper legal daily even directly criticized mr. nixon who is normally referred to here as an old friend
the paper accused him of being a leading <unk> of peaceful evolution a catch phrase to describe what china believes is the policy of western countries to <unk> socialist nations into the capitalist <unk>
the tension was evident on wednesday evening during mr. nixon 's final <unk> <unk> normally an opportunity for <unk> <unk> about <unk> friendship
instead mr. nixon reminded his host chinese president <unk> <unk> that americans have n't <unk> china 's leaders for the military assault of june N that killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators
many in the united states including many friends of china believe the crackdown was excessive and <unk> mr. nixon told mr. <unk> who was directly involved in ordering the attack
the events of april through june damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of china
the chinese responded in an equally <unk> fashion
in talks with mr. nixon chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings and even suggested that the u.s. was <unk> involved in the demonstrations this spring
in a meeting tuesday supreme leader deng <unk> told mr. nixon frankly speaking the u.s. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and <unk> <unk> which occurred in beijing not long ago
china was the real victim and it is <unk> to <unk> china for it
despite the harsh exchanges the u.s. and china still seem to be looking for a way to <unk> relations which have deteriorated into what mr. nixon referred to as the greatest crisis in <unk> relations since his initial visit to china N years ago

according to an american member of the nixon party the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his N hours of talks with <unk> chinese officials
these included china 's economic policies human rights and the question of mr. <unk>
mr. nixon also proposed that china restore its participation in the <unk> program a u.s. <unk> academic exchange
china pulled out of the program in july
in his talks the former president urged china 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the <unk> of outside contacts and ideas
ideas are going over borders and there 's no sdi ideological weapon that can shoot them down he told a group of americans at the u.s. embassy on wednesday
there are no signs however of china 's yielding on key issues
but in one minor matter mr. nixon appears to have gained a <unk>
in a meeting with premier <unk> <unk> on monday mr. nixon said that he hoped he would n't <unk> guards with machine guns during his visit to the u.s. embassy
sure enough when he arrived at the embassy two days later the <unk> guards were gone for the first time in five months
a few blocks away at the u.s. ambassador 's residence the guards <unk> the compound also had discarded their <unk> arms for the first time since early june
but the guards there retained their <unk> and a large contingent of <unk> police remained nearby in <unk> cars

japan is very concerned about the possible effects of program trading a senior japanese official said after the oct. N stock plunge in new york
u.s. stock-index futures are n't even traded in japan now

both <unk> c. <unk> who heads salomon in tokyo and john s. <unk> who heads morgan stanley there <unk> a good part of their firms ' success in tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients
they do n't have plans to cut back
it has not been <unk> in the markets here mr. <unk> said
the real difference seems to be that the cash market here is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in america
the british also are <unk> program trades
index-arbitrage trading is something we want to watch closely an official at london 's stock exchange said
we do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment
london serves increasingly as a <unk> for program trading of u.s. stocks
market professionals said london has several <unk>
first the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the u.s. or london stock trading tapes
second it can be used to <unk> positions before u.s. trading begins but at prices pegged to the previous session 's big board close
in addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee
still much less index-arbitrage activity is done over here than in the u.s. said richard <unk> chief investment manager at standard life assurance co. which manages about # N billion $ N billion in united kingdom institutional funds
britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments
a financial times-stock exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the london stock exchange 's traded options market
and an ft-se futures contract is traded on the london international financial futures exchange
both contracts have gained a following since the N global market crash
the average number of ft-se option contracts traded on the london exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in N
this year the average of daily contracts traded totaled N up from N a year earlier and from N in N
but a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of <unk> trading was only N N of the size of the underlying equity market exchange officials said
this compares with estimates that the u.s. <unk> market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market
the house voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early N casting a solid N vote for a compromise measure backed by president bush
the vote came after a debate <unk> with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor
advocates said the <unk> rise to $ N an hour by april N is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs
but the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on tuesday by president bush and democratic leaders in congress after congressional republicans urged the white house to <unk> a bit from its previous resistance to compromise
so both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in N raising the wage to $ N an hour from $ N
under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to $ N next april
the senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it
there are no <unk> about this bill rep. pat williams d. <unk> said during house floor debate yesterday
but because it 's all we 've got i 'm going to vote for it
while the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average u.s. manufacturing wage the level of $ N an hour in N will still be less than N N of average factory pay mr. williams said
but rep. <unk> <unk> r. n.j instead praised the house 's acceptance of a new youth training wage a <unk> that gop <unk> have sought for many years
adopting a <unk> policy means getting beyond the nickel and <unk> of the minimum wage mrs. <unk> said
policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help <unk> job skills to <unk> into the work force
labor unions and democrats long fought the idea but recently <unk> to it in the face of bush administration insistence
the compromise sets the training wage at $ N an hour next april and at $ N an hour or N N of the minimum wage in april N
employers can pay the <unk> for N days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another N days if the company uses a <unk> training program for the young workers
the training wage covers only workers who are N to N years old
the white house previously insisted on an <unk> six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job
the u.s. chamber of commerce still opposed to any <unk> increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor N N in two stages between april N and april N will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for american workers and higher prices for american consumers

for six years t. marshall hahn jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the george bush mode kind and <unk>
the question now can he act more like <unk> teddy <unk>
mr. hahn the <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of georgia-pacific corp. is leading the <unk> concern 's unsolicited $ N billion bid for great northern nekoosa corp
nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction mr. hahn has n't faced in his N earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes
so far mr. hahn is trying to <unk> nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough
we are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says
but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies
if a competitor enters the game for example mr. hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival
given that choice associates of mr. hahn and industry observers say the former university president who has developed a reputation for not <unk> for anything would <unk>
there 's a price above which i 'm positive marshall has the <unk> not to pay says <unk> <unk> georgia-pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper
says <unk> associate jerry <unk> vice president corporate development at <unk> industries inc. he is n't of the old school of winning at any cost
he also is a consensus manager insiders say
the decision to make the bid for nekoosa for example was made only after all six members of georgia-pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal even though mr. hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on says mr. <unk>
associates say mr. hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of virginia <unk> institute
assuming that post at the age of N he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says warren h. <unk> a university official who is <unk> a book on mr. hahn
but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand
in N mr. hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were <unk> a university building
that impressed robert b. <unk> georgia-pacific 's chief executive at the time whom mr. hahn had met while <unk> for the institute
in N mr. <unk> <unk> mr. hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals the move <unk> many in georgia-pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world
but mr. hahn rose swiftly through the ranks <unk> a raw intelligence that he says he knew he <unk> early on
the son of a <unk> mr. hahn <unk> first grade because his reading ability was so far above his <unk>
moving rapidly through school he <unk> <unk> beta <unk> from the university of kentucky at age N after spending only N N years in college
he earned his <unk> in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology
mr. hahn agrees that he has a <unk> memory but friends say that 's an <unk>
they call it photographic
mr. hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgia-pacific
taking over as chief executive officer in N he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a <unk> slide in its <unk> business
mr. hahn began selling <unk> businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals
he even sold one unit that made <unk> <unk> covers
at the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while <unk> building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new-home construction
the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction
the formula has paid off so far
georgia-pacific 's sales climbed to $ N billion last year compared with $ N billion in N when mr. hahn took the reins
profit from continuing operations has soared to $ N million from $ N million
mr. hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best
the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive he says
nekoosa would n't be a diversification
it would be a good match mr. hahn and many analysts say of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows
the resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ N billion
but can mr. hahn carry it off
in this instance industry observers say he is entering <unk> waters
says <unk> <unk> an analyst at first manhattan co. this is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced
a house-senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ N million in economic aid for poland that relies heavily on $ N million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal N in hopes of <unk> future trade and investment
for the agency for international development <unk> approved $ N million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the overseas private investment corp. are increased by $ N million over fiscal N as part of the same poland package
the conference approved at least $ N million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than $ N million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush administration
the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the white house and is sharply confined under this year 's budget
these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package and while more ambitious <unk> legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern europe
to accommodate the additional cash assistance the house appropriations committee last week was required to <unk> an estimated $ N million from the pentagon
and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively
the action on poland came as the conference separately approved $ N million for international population planning activities an N N increase over fiscal N
the house and senate are divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant
in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional $ N million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant
the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a california <unk> museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market
panama was stripped of this right because of u.s. differences with the noriega regime but the central american country would have received a quota of N metric tons over a <unk> period ending sept. N N
about a quarter of this share has already been <unk> according to the industry but the remaining N tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of N cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate
the potential sales are nearly $ N million and house majority whip william gray d. pa began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to <unk> countries of the caribbean such as jamaica and <unk>
rep. jerry lewis a conservative <unk> added a provision of his own intended to assist <unk> and the senate then <unk> the list further by including all countries in the u.s. caribbean basin <unk> as well as the philippines backed by the powerful hawaii democrat sen. daniel inouye
jamaica wary of <unk> its caribbean basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr. gray but the greater question is whether mr. inouye who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to <unk> a claim by the philippines
in separate floor action the house <unk> budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ N billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal N
the funding is attached to an estimated $ N billion transportation bill that goes next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all u.s. domestic airline flights
the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the white house but in recent days the senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the house
the most recent example was a nearly $ N billion fiscal N bill funding the state justice and commerce departments
and after losing a battle tuesday night with the senate foreign relations committee <unk> from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference
beauty takes <unk> to safety on bridges
everyone agrees that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced
but there 's disagreement over how to do it
highway officials insist the <unk> <unk> on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from <unk> through
but other people do n't want to lose the bridges ' beautiful sometimes historic features
the primary purpose of a <unk> is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a <unk> view says jack white a planner with the indiana highway department

osha cited nearly N alleged violations of federal electrical <unk> <unk> and other requirements
a second <unk> covering the company 's <unk> pa. coke works involved more than N alleged violations of <unk> and other requirements for which osha proposed $ N million in fines
labor secretary elizabeth dole said the magnitude of these penalties and <unk> is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate <unk> to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards
osha said there have been three worker <unk> at the two plants in the past two years and N deaths since N
gerard <unk> the head of osha said usx managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years yet have failed to take necessary action to <unk> the hazards
particularly <unk> mrs. dole said are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its <unk> works in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier <unk> settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies
that settlement was in april N
a usx spokesman said the company had n't yet received any documents from osha regarding the penalty or fine
once we do they will receive very serious evaluation the spokesman said
no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees
usx said it has been <unk> with osha since the agency began investigating the <unk> and <unk> works
he said that if and when safety problems were identified they were corrected
the usx <unk> represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by osha under mr. <unk>
he has promised <unk> fines though the size of penalties sought by osha have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year
the big problem is that usx management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to <unk> safety and health in the plants said linda <unk> osha regional administrator in philadelphia
usx has N working days to contest the <unk> and proposed penalties before the independent <unk> safety and health review commission

we have made no such statement
it is clear that most <unk> ill people and most <unk> do not become homeless
the causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case

you did not note that the homeless people we examined had a <unk> of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse
they suffered from <unk> <unk> diseases cardiovascular disorders skin problems <unk> diseases and the <unk> of <unk> and rape
homeless people not only lack safety privacy and shelter they also lack the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and basic health care
in a recent report the institute of medicine pointed out that certain health problems may <unk> a person to homelessness others may be a consequence of it and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter
the <unk> between health and homelessness are complex <unk> sweeping <unk> as to cause or effect
if we look to the future preventing homelessness is an important objective
this will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently <unk> an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research

the house passed legislation designed to make it easier for the transportation department to block airline leveraged buy-outs
the final vote came after the house rejected republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor
the bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an <unk> <unk> into the affairs of industry but the N vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto
the broader question is where the senate stands on the issue
while the senate commerce committee has approved legislation similar to the house bill on airline leveraged buy-outs the measure has n't yet come to the full floor
although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the transportation department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt
the purpose of the bill is to put the <unk> on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would <unk> safety or a carrier 's ability to compete rep. john paul <unk> r. ark said
the bill as it was approved by the house public works and transportation committee would give the transportation department up to N days to review any purchase of N N or more of the stock in an airline
the department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be <unk> its ability to compete would be sharply diminished it would be put into foreign control or if the transaction would result in the sale of <unk> assets unless selling such assets had an <unk> public benefit
the house approved an amendment offered by rep. peter <unk> d. ore. that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees or their wages or benefits
rep. james <unk> d. ohio said the amendment which passed N would let the american worker know that we consider them occasionally
but rep. <unk> said that the provision which he dubbed a special interest amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial
on tuesday the house approved a <unk> amendment that would require the transportation department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code
the provision called the <unk> amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing texas air corp. chairman frank lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline

you now may drop by the voice of america offices in washington and read the text of what the voice is broadcasting to those N million people around the world who tune in to it each week
you can even take notes extensive notes for the voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder about what you read
you can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of congress
and my newspaper can print the text of those <unk>
until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your <unk> around the world
that was the law
and i apparently had no right to print <unk> what the voice was booming to <unk>
it was censorship
it was <unk>
and it was stupid
the theory was that the voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't <unk> its own people
that sounds neat but this government any government <unk> its own people every day
government press releases <unk> <unk> tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts
propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue
the restrictions on <unk> and <unk> of voice material were especially absurd an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform
in june N i wrote in this space about this issue
assuming it was n't one of those columns that you <unk> and put on the <unk> door i 'll review the facts
the voice of america is a government agency that <unk> news and views some might say propaganda in N <unk> to N million <unk> around the world
it does a <unk> job
its budget $ N million is paid for by you
but a N law barred the <unk> of that material in the u.s.
the law let scholars reporters and researchers read <unk> of <unk> material only at <unk> headquarters in washington but it barred them from copying <unk>
and of course there 's that word <unk>
how 's that again
you may come by the agency to read but not copy either <unk> or by <unk> a voice official explained when i asked
what if i tune in my <unk> radio <unk> an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper
nor are you free to <unk> such material i was advised
that sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere i sued
a couple of weeks ago i lost the case in federal district court in des <unk>
at least that 's the way it was reported
and indeed the lawsuit was dismissed
but i i like to think of it in terms of we all of us won the point
for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling the united states information agency which runs the voice changed its position on three key points
the usia said that on reflection of course i could print anything i could get my hands on
the word <unk> it decided referred only to itself
the usia officially and publicly declared the <unk> right of everyone except the usia to <unk> agency program materials in the united states my lawyer the <unk> mark mccormick of des <unk> said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that i had lost
the court noted the new usia position but just in case officially found that congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from <unk> usia information domestically
the usia said that on reflection anyone could view the <unk> materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute
the usia publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory <unk> because the usia has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and <unk> to see the materials mr. mccormick noted
and the usia said that all of us could take extensive notes
the agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take <unk> notes no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken mr. mccormick reported
i had sought in my suit the right to print voice material which had been denied me and i had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if i have no right to get the information
but the court disagreed
the first amendment <unk> the government from passing laws <unk> the right to free speech judge donald o'brien ruled
the first amendment does not <unk> a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press
so now the situation is this
you have a right to read voice of america scripts if you do n't mind traveling to washington every week or so and visiting the voice office during business hours
i have a right to print those scripts if i go there and <unk> but no longer <unk> copy them out in long hand
but neither of us can copy the material on a xerox machine or have it sent to us
in an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not this does seem odd
indeed judge o'brien ruled that it would be easy to conclude that the usia 's position is inappropriate or even stupid but it 's the law
so the next step i suspect is to try to get the law changed
we i assume you 're in this with me at this point need to get three words for examination only eliminated from the law
section N of the united states information and educational exchange act of N says voice material shall be available to certain of us but now thanks to the usia 's new position all of us for examination only
if those words were n't there the nice people at the voice would be able to send you the information or at the very least let you <unk> it
this is not a <unk> issue
you have raised important questions which ought to be answered what does usia say about america abroad how do we say it and how can american taxpayers get the answers to these questions a man wrote me a couple of years ago
the man was charles <unk> <unk>
at the time he was director of the
he had no answers then
now there are some

mr. mcgovern was widely seen as sales and not profit <unk>

some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation which has contributed to volatility of campbell shares in recent months
campbell 's international businesses particularly in the u.k. and italy appear to be at the heart of its problems
growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in u.s. units
for example campbell is a distant third in the u.k. frozen foods market where it recently paid N times earnings for <unk> foods plc and wound up with far more capacity than it could use
similarly campbell 's italian <unk> operation d. <unk> & co. has been hurt by <unk> and distribution problems
such problems will require considerable <unk> to resolve
however neither mr. baum nor mr. harper has much international experience
mr. baum a <unk> marketer who is said to have a good <unk> with campbell employees will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the <unk> farm unit
mr. harper a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined campbell in N will take charge of all overseas operations as well as <unk>
in an joint interview yesterday both men said they would like to be the company 's next chief executive
mr. mcgovern N had been under intense pressure from the board to boost campbell 's <unk> performance to the level of other food companies
the board is dominated by the <unk> of the late john t. dorrance jr. who controlled about N N of campbell 's stock when he died in april
in recent months mr. dorrance 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity
in august the company took a $ N million pretax charge against fiscal N earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan
the plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about N jobs
but analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing especially in europe and there were signs that the board became <unk>
campbell officials said mr. mcgovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure
the company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying the ceo succession is well along and i 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement
but people familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in london said mr. mcgovern was fired
mr. mcgovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of N in october N unless i get fired
campbell said mr. mcgovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for nov. N
for fiscal N mr. mcgovern received a salary of $ N
he owns about N shares of campbell stock and has options to buy more than N additional shares
he will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ N with certain other <unk> benefits
during mr. mcgovern 's <unk> term as president the company 's sales rose to $ N billion from $ N billion and net income increased to $ N million from $ N million the statement said
mr. baum said he and mr. harper both <unk> closing some plants as long ago as early N
you 've got to make the restructuring work said mr. baum
you 've got to make those savings now
mr. harper expressed confidence that he and mr. baum can convince the board of their <unk> to run the company
we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team he said
he predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive
mr. baum said the two have orders to focus on <unk> profits and to take a hard look at our businesses what is good what is not so good
analysts generally <unk> the performance of campbell u.s.a. the company 's largest division which posted N N unit sales growth and a N N improvement in operating profit for fiscal N
the way that we 've been managing campbell u.s.a. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company mr. baum said
in the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon both men <unk> confidence and seemed to work well together
you 've got two <unk> sitting right before you said mr. baum
we play to win

robert l. bernstein chairman and president of random house inc. announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for N years
a successor was n't named which fueled speculation that mr. bernstein may have <unk> with <unk> newhouse jr. whose family company advance publications inc. owns random house
abrupt departures are n't <unk> of within the newhouse empire
in an interview mr. bernstein said his departure <unk> out of discussions with <unk> newhouse and that 's the decision i reached
he declined to elaborate other than to say it just seemed the right thing to do at this minute
sometimes you just go with your gut
mr. bernstein said he will stay until dec. N and work with his successor who is to be named soon
mr. newhouse meanwhile insisted that he is n't unhappy with mr. bernstein or the performance of random house the largest trade publishing house in the u.s.
the company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ N million from $ N million during mr. bernstein 's tenure
bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite <unk> said mr. newhouse
the company is doing well it 's stable it 's got good people
bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time
publishing officials believe that while random house has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily
crown publishing group acquired last year is said to be turning in disappointing results
as a private company random house does n't report its earnings
mr. bernstein who succeeded bennett <unk> has been only the second president of random house since it was founded in N
speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house
possible candidates include susan <unk> president of <unk> <unk> random house 's huge and successful <unk> division
some say anthony <unk> head of a recently acquired british company century hutchinson could be chosen
there is also speculation that mr. newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another newhouse family member to run the business side in combination with a publishing executive like robert <unk> who left random house 's alfred a. <unk> to run the new yorker also owned by the newhouse family
not included on the <unk> list are <unk> evans recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for random house and <unk> mehta president of the prestigious alfred a. <unk> unit
when ms. evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator
mr. mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a <unk> administrator and his own departure was rumored recently
mr. bernstein a tall energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues
congress learned during the reagan administration that it could <unk> the executive branch by <unk> again and again the same seven words provided that no funds shall be spent
this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress
it signals congress 's attempt under the <unk> of <unk> the public <unk> to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in article ii of the constitution
this <unk> of congressional action is <unk> on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is <unk> and unconstitutional
the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law
the prevailing interpretation of the clause on capitol hill is that it gives congress an <unk> veto over every <unk> action of the president through the ability to <unk> funding
this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in N in the iran-contra report
as <unk> of congressional power understand a power of the <unk> so broadly <unk> would <unk> the presidency and <unk> the principle of separation of powers
it is not supported by the text or history of the constitution
the <unk> hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of N according to madison 's notes
to the extent they did their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability
moreover the <unk> believed that the nation needed a <unk> executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the confederation congress had performed poorly under the articles of confederation
it would <unk> that objective if the appropriations clause technically a <unk> on legislative power could be read as placing the president on congress 's short <unk> making the executive consist of the president and every member of congress
as it went to the conference panel now <unk> the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal N contained some <unk> attempts by congress to rewrite the constitution under the <unk> of protecting the public 's money
during the coming weeks president bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their <unk> on executive power to be in violation of article ii and thus <unk> and <unk>
the N appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article ii
article ii places on the president the duty to <unk> and by and with the advice and consent of the senate <unk> <unk> judges and other officers of the u.s.
it also <unk> the president to make <unk> appointments without senate approval the president shall have power to fill up all <unk> that may happen during the <unk> of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session
yet section N of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides no part of any <unk> for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been <unk> after the senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person
thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill congress <unk> the president 's power to make <unk> appointments under article ii
section N also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> candidates of his choosing
the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected <unk> will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary
the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the <unk> act prohibits voluntary service to the government
the N appropriations bills also contain a number of <unk> provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution
<unk> provisions which might be called <unk> laws as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to congress
such laws violate the provision in article ii that requires the president to make recommendations to congress but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations
typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from <unk> into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more <unk> alternatives to regulations
probably the most <unk> example is a <unk> in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's office of management and budget from <unk> agricultural marketing orders to any <unk> scrutiny
there is something <unk> suspect about congress 's <unk> the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other
perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal N better illustrates congress 's attempt to <unk> executive power than section N of the <unk> bill none of the funds made available <unk> to the provisions of this act shall be used to implement <unk> or enforce any regulation which has been <unk> <unk> to a resolution of <unk> <unk> adopted in <unk> with the applicable law of the united states
this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law since a <unk> resolution could be said to be <unk> adopted even though it would require neither <unk> action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto
the supreme court 's decision in <unk> v. <unk> held that legislative <unk> are unconstitutional
president bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> his duties and exercise his prerogatives
if president bush fails to do so in his first year he will <unk> congress for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite article ii of the constitution to suit its purposes
what becomes custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents including democrats to undo
president reagan learned that lesson
by N <unk> jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii
if a veto is <unk> because it would leave part of the executive branch <unk> the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and <unk> a power of <unk> declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and <unk>
the constitution does not <unk> give the president such power
however the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution
the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto
<unk> of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and <unk> under article ii would be different from the line-item veto
as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to <unk> perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are <unk> merely because they conflict with his policy objectives
the <unk> of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited <unk>
one could argue that it is not an <unk> of a item veto at all for the president by <unk> a power of <unk> to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers
there is no downside if the president asserts a right of <unk> over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal N appropriations bills
if congress does nothing president bush will have won
if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court assuming it can establish standing to sue president bush might win
in that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a <unk> of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the <unk> thought should be <unk> to the executive
if president bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as morrison v. <unk> was for the reagan administration
but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now
moreover the <unk> would have received a valuable <unk> lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice
as it stands now congress <unk> after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down
president bush should set things straight
if he does not he will help realize madison 's fear in the <unk> no. N of a legislature everywhere extending the <unk> of its activity and drawing all powers into its <unk> <unk>
mr. <unk> served as an attorney in the reagan administration
his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year
despite one of the most devastating <unk> on record net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of $ N billion last year
the previous record was $ N billion in N according to the agriculture department
net cash income the amount left in farmers ' pockets after <unk> expenses from gross cash income increased in N states in N as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department 's economic research service reported yesterday
most of those states set farm income records
the worst crop damage occurred in the midwestern corn belt and the northern great plains
what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had <unk> to the government under <unk> loan programs
with prices soaring they were able to sell the <unk> commodities at considerable profit the agency 's <unk> report said
in less <unk> areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production <unk> greatly from the higher prices
to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the <unk> states including indiana illinois nebraska and the <unk>
analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ N billion <unk> package enacted by congress
last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s
it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm <unk> and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the N farm program next year
commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record <unk> earlier this year as the government curtailed production with <unk> programs to reduce <unk> surpluses
at the same time export demand for u.s. wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said keith collins a department analyst
farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low
all of these forces came together in N to benefit agriculture mr. collins said
california led the nation with $ N billion in net cash income last year followed by texas $ N billion iowa $ N billion florida $ N billion and minnesota $ N billion
iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states to <unk> a decline in net cash income
despite federal disaster relief the drought of N was a severe financial setback for an estimated N to N farmers according to the department
many lost their farms
department economists do n't expect N to be as good a year as N was
indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline
at the same time an increase of land under <unk> after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that has been only partly <unk> by heavy grain buying by the soviets
last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ N billion from a record $ N billion in N
payments are expected to range between $ N billion and $ N billion this year
after years of struggling the los angeles herald examiner will publish its last edition today shut down by its parent hearst corp. following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper
the demise of the <unk> herald once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding N turns the country 's second-largest city into a <unk> town at least in some <unk>
the los angeles times with a circulation of more than N million dominates the region
but it faces stiff competition in orange county from the orange county register which sells more than N copies a day and in the san fernando valley from the los angeles daily news which sells more than N
nearby cities such as pasadena and long beach also have large <unk>
in july closely held hearst based in new york put the paper on the block
speculation had it that the company was asking $ N million for an operation said to be losing about $ N million a year but others said hearst might have virtually given the paper away
an attempted buy-out led by john j. <unk> chief operating officer never materialized and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as <unk> and <unk> had filed through since
the prospective buyers included investor marvin davis and the toronto sun
the death of the herald a <unk> paper in a freeway town was perhaps inevitable
los angeles is a <unk> <unk> newspaper market and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the <unk> times then target a particular area with one of the regional <unk>
the herald was left in limbo
further the herald seemed torn <unk> between keeping its <unk> hearst <unk> blue-collar and <unk> and trying to provide a <unk> upscale alternative to the sometimes <unk> times
hearst had <unk> with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan
the herald joins the baltimore <unk> which <unk> and the boston <unk> which was sold as <unk> of the old hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s
many felt hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did if marginally because of its place in family history
its <unk> offices were designed by architect <unk> morgan who built the hearst castle at san <unk>
william <unk> hearst had kept an apartment in the spanish <unk> building
analysts said the herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry
the herald was a <unk> from a <unk> age said j. <unk> noble a media analyst with painewebber inc
actually the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end and the industry looks pretty healthy
founded as the examiner in N by mr. hearst the herald was <unk> by a bitter <unk> strike that began in N and cut circulation in half
financially it never recovered <unk> it had its moments
in N hearst hired editor james <unk> who <unk> the editorial product considerably
he and his successor mary anne <unk> restored respect for the editorial product and though in recent years the paper had been <unk> along on limited resources its <unk> were notable
for example the herald consistently beat its <unk> rival on disclosures about los angeles mayor tom bradley 's financial dealings
the herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded
robert j. <unk> vice president and general manager of hearst newspapers stood up in the paper 's <unk> yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would <unk> putting more than N full-time employees out of work
hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for N days
some <unk> employees will receive additional benefits the company said
hours after the announcement representatives of the orange county register were in a bar across the street recruiting
the reaction in the <unk> was emotional
i 've never seen so many people <unk> in one place at one time said bill johnson an assistant city editor
so long l.a. was chosen as the paper 's final headline
i 'm doing the main story and i 'm already two beers drunk said reporter andy <unk> whom the times hired away several years ago but who returned to the herald out of preference
his wife also works for the paper as did his father
outside a young <unk> filling a news box with an extra edition <unk> herald examiner closes refused to take a reader 's quarter
forget it he said as he handed her a paper
it does n't make any difference now
olympia broadcasting corp. said it did n't make a $ N million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ N million of senior subordinated debentures
the <unk> owner and <unk> said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions
it said it needs to make the payment by dec. N to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt
in september the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business
if you 'd really rather have a buick do n't leave home without the american express card
or so the <unk> might go
american express co. and general motors corp. 's beleaguered buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the american express card
the companies are giving four-day <unk> for two to buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the american express green card
they have begun sending letters explaining the program which began oct. N and will end dec. N to about five million card holders
neither company would disclose the program 's cost
buick approached american express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a good credit history and are good at making payments says a spokeswoman for the division
american express also represents the upscale image we 're trying to project she adds
buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as the doctor 's car a product for upscale professionals
sales were roughly flat in the N model year compared with a year earlier though industry sales fell
but since the N model year began oct. N buick sales have plunged N N
for american express the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business
traditionally the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses
<unk> <unk> an american express executive vice president says the promotion with buick is his company 's first with an auto maker but hopefully will be the first of many in the company 's effort to promote its green card as the total <unk> card
to that end american express has been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card
many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the american express card but few card holders realize this mr. <unk> says
until now however buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through general motors acceptance corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with <unk> and state disclosure laws over finance rates says a spokesman for the gm finance arm
but gmac approved the buick program he says because the american express green card requires payment in full upon billing and so does n't carry any finance rates
mr. <unk> says american express considers gm and buick very sophisticated direct-mail marketers so by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability
in addition buick is a relatively respected <unk> among american express card holders says an american express spokeswoman
when the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases buick came in fourth among u.s. cars and in the top N of all cars the spokeswoman says
american express has more than N million card holders in the u.s. and over half have the green card
gmac <unk> the <unk> list for holders more than N years old with household incomes over $ N who had n't missed any payments the buick spokeswoman says
some N million of the five million who will get letters were <unk> for credit with gmac
these N million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off gmac 's advertised finance rates which start at N N for two-year loan contracts
a spokesman for visa international 's u.s. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards but does n't have plans for a <unk> similar to the american <unk> link
three divisions at american express are working with buick on the promotion the establishment services division which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card the travel division and the merchandise sales division
the vacation packages include hotel <unk> and in some cases tours or tickets to local <unk> but not meals
<unk> are chicago <unk> las vegas nev. los angeles miami beach fla. new orleans new york <unk> fla. san francisco and washington d.c.
a buyer who chooses to fly to his <unk> must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on united airlines
in <unk> of the vacation buyers can choose among several prizes including a <unk> <unk> or a stereo videocassette recorder
card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a <unk> with buick cars or a hawaii vacation as prizes
if they <unk> a buick they get an american express <unk>
this is n't buick 's first <unk> promotion
a few years ago the company offered two <unk> tickets on trans world airlines to buyers of its <unk> luxury car
the promotion helped <unk> sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than N N buick said at the time
the united kingdom high court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a london borough council and commercial banks
the ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the london borough of <unk> and <unk> ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions
as many as N u.k. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities
an appeal is expected
in response to the ruling <unk> futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session
<unk> or british government bonds which also fell sharply initially <unk> some of the losses to end about N point lower
the council which is alleged to have engaged in over N deals valued at over # N billion $ N billion lost millions of pounds from <unk> swap deals
at one point <unk> is reported to have accounted for as much as N N of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings
when two parties engage in an interest-rate swap they are betting against each other on future rates
thus an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments
in most of the british transactions the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks which would make fixed-rate payments
as interest rates rose municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them
the court hearing began in early october at the request of anthony <unk> district <unk> for <unk> who argued that local <unk> are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such <unk> activities
the council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal
although the <unk> and <unk> council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such <unk> transactions the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by N other local <unk>
while this court ruling was only on <unk> it will obviously be very <unk> in other cases of a similar nature a <unk> representing one of the banks said
already N local <unk> have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings
other financial institutions involved include barclays bank plc midland bank plc security pacific corp. chemical banking corp. 's chemical bank citicorp 's citibank and mitsubishi finance international
if the banks <unk> all <unk> of appeal it is possible that they would seek to have the <unk> ruling work both ways some market sources said
banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in <unk> where the banks made net payments to <unk>
officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable
the banks have N days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly
in the aftermath of the stock market 's <unk> 190-point drop on oct. N kidder peabody & co. 's N stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and <unk> campaign aimed at <unk> the country 's second-largest program trader
the target of their <unk>
their own employer kidder peabody
since october 's <unk> wall street has been shaken by an explosion of <unk> against program trading the computer-driven <unk> trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes
but the <unk> fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market
the real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards
program trading itself according to many <unk> who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace
the evidence indicates that program trading did n't in fact cause the market 's sharp fall on oct. N though it may have <unk> it
on one side of this power struggle stand the forces in <unk> on wall street the new guard consisting of high-tech computer <unk> at the major brokerage firms their pension fund clients with <unk> pools of money and the traders at the fast-growing chicago futures exchanges
these are the main proponents of program trading
defending their <unk> are wall street 's old guard the traditional <unk> money managers tens of thousands of stock brokers the new york stock exchange 's listed companies and the <unk> floor traders known as specialists who make markets in their stocks
so far wall street 's old guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle successfully <unk> public and congressional opinion to <unk> their <unk>
the chicago mercantile exchange a major futures marketplace yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market and the big board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading
<unk> by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a <unk> <unk> almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage a common form of program trading for their own accounts in the past few days
a few such as giant merrill lynch & co. now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients
the old guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based in part because some old guard members feel their very <unk> is at stake
some such as traditional money manager neuberger & <unk> have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators stop the numbers <unk> on wall street
big board stock specialists in a bold palace <unk> began shortly after oct. N to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the big board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading
charles wohlstetter the chairman of contel corp. who is <unk> other <unk> to the <unk> trading cause says he has received <unk> letters offering support
they said <unk> without a single exception do n't even compromise
kill it he says
wall street 's new guard is n't likely to take all this lying down for long however
its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable
program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has <unk> them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them
what 's more the last time major wall street firms said they were getting out of program trading in the aftermath of the N crash they waited a few months and then <unk> back into it
even some members of the old guard despite their current advantage seem to be <unk> that the future belongs with the new guard
last week robert m. bradley one of the big board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization surrendered
he sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. in which he said the big board is too focused on machines rather than people
he said the exchange is headed for a real crisis if program trading is n't <unk>
i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino mr. bradley wrote
the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations causing internal <unk> and <unk> employee against employee
at kidder a unit of general electric co. and other big brokerage firms stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away
corporations like contel <unk> program trading yet contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like bankers trust co. that are also big program traders
the big board the nation 's premier stock exchange is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives
its entrenched N stock specialists firms are fighting <unk> and <unk> against programs
but the big board 's leadership over the specialists ' protests two weeks ago began trading a new stock basket product designed to facilitate program trading
a lot of people would like to go back to N before program trading mr. phelan said this week
i would like to go back to N
but we are not going back to N
again and again program-trading 's critics raise the casino theme
they say greedy market <unk> have made a <unk> of the nation 's <unk> system turning the stock market into a big gambling <unk> with the odds heavily <unk> against the small investor
the public did n't come to the market to play a game they can go to <unk> betting for that says a. <unk> murray chairman of <unk> murray foster securities a traditional money management firm
the program traders on the other hand <unk> old-fashioned stock pickers as the <unk> of the industry
critics like mr. murray are looking for <unk> and people who use computers to trade are a convenient <unk> says j. thomas allen president of advanced investment management inc. a pittsburgh firm that runs a $ N million fund that uses index arbitrage
just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to <unk> the regulators for protection
for all the furor there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage the most controversial type of <unk> program trading
like other forms of arbitrage it merely seeks to take advantage of <unk> discrepancies in the price of a single product in this case a basket of stocks in different markets in this case the new york stock exchange and the chicago futures markets
that divergence is what stock index traders seek
when it occurs the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the N stocks that constitute the standard & poor 's N stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market they lock in the difference in price as profit
such program trades which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock occur in a matter of seconds
a program trade of $ N million of stock typically earns a <unk> profit of $ N
to keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity their computers find
the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics <unk> to <unk>
if you continue to do this the investor becomes frightened any investor the odd <unk> mutual funds and pension funds says larry <unk> managing partner at neuberger & <unk>
but many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations
i have not seen one <unk> of evidence to support restrictions on program trading says a <unk> university finance professor <unk> stoll an authority on the subject
says the big board 's mr. phelan volatility is greater than program trading
the oct. N plunge was triggered not by program traders but by news of the <unk> of the $ N billion buy-out of ual corp
unable to unload ual and other airline shares takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers dumped every blue-chip stock they had
while program trades swiftly kicked in a circuit breaker that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program trading impossible
susan del <unk> head trader at travelers investment management co. says critics are ignoring the role the takeover stock <unk> is taking in the market as a source of volatility
many <unk> are <unk> she says and they have to sell when things look like they fall apart
like virtually everything on wall street the program-trading battle is over money and the <unk> have been losing out on <unk> of it to the new guard in recent years
take the traditional money managers or stock pickers as they are <unk> known among the computer <unk>
traditional stock managers like to charge N cents to N cents for every $ N they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors
yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with much less beat the returns of standard <unk> like the s&p
not surprisingly <unk> money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to <unk> portfolios so they mirror the s&p N
the <unk> charge only a few pennies per $ N managed
today about $ N billion or N N of all <unk> stock investments is held by index funds
the new wall street of computers and automated trading threatens to make <unk> of the N big board <unk> firms
these small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of N N to N N a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks
the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death <unk>
and they believe the big board under mr. phelan has abandoned their interest
the son of a specialist and once one himself mr. phelan has nonetheless been <unk> with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets
meanwhile specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility
when the sell programs hit you can hear the order printers start to go on the big board trading floor says one specialist there
the buyers walk away and the specialist is left alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends
no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers
they are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the N stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then
small investors are absolutely <unk> that wall street is <unk> the deck against them and these wide swings are scaring them to death says raymond a. mason chairman of regional broker legg mason inc. in baltimore
stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling
last year the average broker earned $ N N N lower than in N
corporate executives <unk> that their company 's stock has been transformed into a <unk> piece of a stock-index basket
index traders who buy all N stocks in the s&p N often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do complains andrew <unk> chairman of champion international corp
do you make <unk> or <unk>
oh you 're in the paper business is one reaction mr. <unk> says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders
by this september program traders were doing a record N N of the big board 's average daily trading volume
among the top practitioners were wall street blue <unk> morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody merrill lynch salomon brothers inc. and painewebber group inc
but then came oct. N and the negative publicity <unk> by the old guard particularly against index arbitrage
the <unk> ' strategy for the moment is to <unk> down and let the furor die
there 's a <unk> psychology right now says the top program-trading official at a wall street firm
wall street 's cash <unk> has been <unk> but i do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem
too much money is at stake for program traders to give up
for example stock-index futures began trading in chicago in N and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched
stock futures trading has <unk> dozens of <unk> in their <unk> and <unk>
now on a good day chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock
now the stage is set for the battle to play out
the <unk> are getting some helpful <unk> from congress
program traders ' power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way says rep. edward markey a massachusetts democrat
we have to have a system that says to those largest investors
sit down
you will not panic
you will not put the financial system in jeopardy
but the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon
many people including the big board think that it 's too late to put the <unk> back in the bottle
the big board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions but a total ban is n't being considered big board officials say
you 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks says <unk> 's prof. stoll
program trading is here to stay and computers are here to stay and we just need to understand it
short of a total ban some <unk> have proposed several <unk> reforms which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't
one such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement or the <unk> payment of cash needed to trade them to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks
currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly N N compared with N N for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative
program trading critics also want the federal reserve board rather than the futures industry to set such margins
futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active
higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell they say
another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an uptick rule a reform instituted after the great crash of N that protects against stocks being <unk> beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers
the big board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price
but in N program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets
a <unk> of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably
program traders argue that a <unk> of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets
james a. white contributed to this article
<unk> <unk>
big board chairman john phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild <unk> swings
thus the <unk> psychology of recent days picks up new impetus
index arbitrage is a common form of program trading
as usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same <unk> ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different
in index arbitrage the widget is the s&p N and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york
to profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity someone who owns the s&p N widget in new york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper s&p N widget in chicago
if the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the s&p N index he is likely to remain fully invested at all times
few if any <unk> managers will risk <unk> performance by owning more than N N exposure to stocks and equally few will want to own less than a N N position should stocks rise
by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget index-arbitrage traders hope to add between N N and N N to the annual return of the s&p N
that represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective
the fact that a vast majority of <unk> money managers fail to beat the s&p N may contribute to the <unk> surrounding the issue
as more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and eventually eliminated
the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the s&p N is more <unk> than <unk> in the futures market
the new york stock exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' <unk> to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares
so if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin <unk> between two markets for the same widget how did program trading <unk> into the evil <unk> that is <unk> the <unk> of so many observers
all arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after reforms are implemented N reduced volatility N a long-term investment focus and N a level playing field for the small investor
but many of these reforms are <unk> even harmful
reducing volatility
an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs
arbitrage does n't cause volatility it <unk> to it
think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for s&p N stocks usually it is large investors <unk> a buy or sell in chicago
a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures
arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from chicago to new york while <unk> as a buyer in chicago
the start of the whole process is the key someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in <unk> to make widget prices move
why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york
perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade
in a competitive market this investor has many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle
if not chicago then in new york if not the u.s. then overseas
volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or <unk> to a widget market with <unk> liquidity
eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less
the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not <unk>
if slowing things down could reduce volatility stone <unk> should become the trade ticket of the future
encouraging long-term investing
we must be very cautious about <unk> investors as long-term or short-term
policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are <unk> to placing a sign over the big board 's door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away
the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term
a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can <unk>
in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today
periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were <unk> change N N and N for example
it is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers <unk> <unk> on program trading when the markets decline while <unk> the great values still <unk> as the markets rise
could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil <unk> of program-trading <unk>
some of the proposed <unk> for what is labeled program-trading volatility could be far worse than the perceived problem
in using program trading as a <unk> boy <unk> investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing <unk> products
they may however risk bringing some damaging <unk> from outside the markets themselves
how does a nice new tax say N N on any financial transaction sound
that ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term
getting a level playing field
this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for <unk> program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms <unk> the cause
the <unk> of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors
they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients continue to hope for superior performance
even with mutual funds the little investor continues to <unk> high fees high commissions and poor performance while <unk> managers slowly <unk> a better record with lower fees lower commissions and less risk
yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert <unk> <unk> press <unk> on each company he follows
almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences
if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors
the sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue <unk> performers first while leaving institutions to <unk> with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter
<unk> index funds just are n't <unk> enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay and that institutional customers refuse to pay
each new trading <unk> is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their <unk> clients here or overseas
<unk> new trading <unk> will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors
so what is next for program trading
left to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient making it harder and harder to do profitably
spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit
if government or private <unk> insist however on introducing greater <unk> between the markets limits on price moves <unk> execution higher margin requirements taxation etc. the end loser will be the markets themselves
instead we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants

some democrats in congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years
the funding mechanism which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by president bush would affect the antitrust operations of the justice department and the federal trade commission
as a part of overall efforts to reduce spending congress cut by $ N million the bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N which began oct. N
to offset the reduction congress approved a $ N fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions
some democrats led by rep. jack brooks d. texas unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts
but justice department and ftc officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them
it could operate to <unk> our budget james <unk> the justice department 's antitrust chief said in an interview
under measures approved by both houses of congress the administration 's request for $ N million for the antitrust division would be cut $ N million
the ftc budget request of $ N million about $ N million of which would go for antitrust enforcement would also be cut by $ N million
the administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N as was appropriated in fiscal N
the offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the hart-scott-rodino act
under that law parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ N million or more must notify ftc and justice department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions
currently the government charges nothing for such filings
proponents of the funding arrangement predict that based on recent filing levels of more than N a year the fees will yield at least $ N million this fiscal year or $ N million more than the budget cuts
when you do that there is not a cut but there is in fact a program increase of $ N million each for the ftc and the justice department rep. neal smith d. iowa said during house debate
but rep. don edwards d. calif responded that a recession could <unk> merger activity reducing the amount of fees collected
the antitrust staffs of both the ftc and justice department were cut more than N N in the reagan administration and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period
today is not the time to signal that congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen mr. edwards argued
any money in excess of $ N million collected from the fees in fiscal N would go to the treasury at large
corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions
though some lawyers reported that prospective <unk> were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings
